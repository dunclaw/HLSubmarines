description = Empties the vessel of air except for crew compartments.  These tanks provide buoyancy or ballast to control your depth in the ocean.  Nearby kerbonauts will sink!  Do not go too deep or you may be crushed by pressure!

// A kerbonaut was waiting for recovery on seaside beach.  He noticed a curious piece of debris washed upon the shore.  He was surprised to find a note still taped inside of it.  It read, "Are the oceans... the final frontiers?"
